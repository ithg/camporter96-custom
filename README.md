# Installation / Usage

## Step 1

Download Python 3 https://www.python.org/downloads/ and proceed with advanced settings. Set installation folder to "C:/Python" to make things easier. While installing make sure you checked "add python to PATH" and "install pip".

## Step 2

Download CustomGrids.py and place it to C:/Python (where you installed Python)

## Step 3

Open cmd.exe and use
```bash
$ cd C:/Phyton
```
then
```bash
$ pip install requests
```
now you can run the script by using
```bash
$ python CustomGrids.py
```
if it doesn't return any error than it means it is working. Wait until script finish downloading. (Around 100mb)

# Tips

If you want to customize the script to use for your only one steam account, just remove line 12 and comment on line 11, replace PATH to your own personal grid path.
